For this game i used Texture2D map to create level.

You can find Template texture map where located in Texture>LevelTexture

In TextureTemplate, black areas are none-placeable areas such as checkpoint or player spawn point.
Other empty areas are placeable areas.

TextureMap created by 19x210 pixel. Every half pixel represent spawn position for collectables. And every color represent
collectables type.

For Example:

On (4,50) Green pixel present that at that position there is a green collectable (in this project is Cube).
On (17,180) Red pixel present that at that position there is a red collectable (in this project is sphere).
On (13,95) Blue pixel present that at that position there is a blue collectable (in this project is capsule).

You can use any edit tool to create your own map easly and fast.
